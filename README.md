## Mathematics and Chemistry
This is a repository for various ML methods and some older chemometrics methods. Any mathematical model is not reality itself, but a useful tool to look into a hypothesis with greater logical detail. Belief in absolute truth in mathematical models is seen in objective bayes, however as a natural scientist it seems to me that subjective baysianism places the hypothesis where it needs to be--how do I know what I know. As clear as the distinction between the idea of the chemical, and the actual presentation of our truly probabalistic understanding of that chemical in quantum mechanics. Not so clear as many data scientists would have us believe. It seems to me that the varieties of data processing strategies are truly as complicated as the human imagination itself. The important part about mathematics is that this imagination can be communicated through pure logic. However, let us not forget the whole left-side of cognition! Intuition!

"The real problem in speech is not precise language. The problem is clear language. The desire is to have the idea clearly communicated to the other person. It is only necessary to be precise when there is some doubt as to the meaning of a phrase, and then the precision should be put in the place where the doubt exists. It is really quite impossible to say anything with absolute precision, unless that thing is so abstracted from the real world as to not represent any real thing. Pure mathematics is just such an abstraction from the real world, and pure mathematics does have a special precise language for dealing with its own special and technical subjects. But this precise language is not precise in any sense if you deal with real objects of the world, and it is only pedantic and quite confusing to use it unless there are some special subtleties which have to be carefully distinguished." --Richard Feynman

"The whole process of learning the facility of being able to play jazz is to take these problems from the outer level in, one by one, and to stay with it at a very intense, conscious-concentration level until that process becomes secondary and subconscious. Now, when that becomes subconscious, then you can begin concentrating on that next problem, which will allow you to do a little bit more." --Bill Evans
